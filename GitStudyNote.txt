Learning how to use Git:

Useful command

> cd + directory_name: Change Directory / Sample: cd ~/Desktop
> mkdir + new_directory_name: make Directory / Sample: mkdir sample
> ls : list all the directory and files
> ls -a: List all the file including the hiden files
> touch + file_name : create a file in the current directory / Sample: touch newFile.txt
> open file_name : Open a file in the current directory / Sampple : open newFile.txt
> vim file_name : open a file in the current directory using terminal for editing purpose / Sample vim newFile.txt

> git init: create a repository in the working directory.
> git  status: to check what files are in the staging area.
> git add + file_name : the command to add the file to the staging area. / Sample: git add newFile.txt
> git add . : the dot represent the whole directory, so this is used to add all the files in the working directory to  the stagin area.
> git commit: the command to commit a file in the staging area. Sample: git commit
> git commit -m "message" : commit with a comment. If verbs are in the comment, it is a best practice to keep it in present tense.
> git log : check the commit history in the working directory.
> git checkout + filename: the command we use to reverse out commit back to the previous version.

> git remote add <the_name_of_the_remotet> <url_of_repository> : tell the local repository we have a online repository and we would like to push the commit to it. by convention, we name the remote origin: 
> git -u <the_name_of_the_remotet> <branch>: Push the commit from local to the online repository. Sample: git -u origin master






Command for Git

>>>>>>git init<<<<<<

> first we would want to create a local git repository to store the files
>>>git init
this is the command we are going to use.


Execution Example: 
yangyu.xi GitStudyNote % git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/yangyu.xie/Desktop/GitStudyNote/.git/

This shows that I created a local repository in the directory: GitStudyNote
make sure we use ls and cd command to change to the current directory, so that our repository will build in the correct place.

this .git directory is hidden, we need to use ls -a to check it's existence.

>>>>>>git status<<<<<<
> Now we have the local repository, we can track the change in particular files
>>> Staging areea: in order to track changes in a particular files, we need to put the target file into a staging araa.
>>> Staging area is a intermidiate space, we can choose which file in our working directory we want to "Commit"
>>> git status: the command to check what is in the staging area.

>>>>>>git add<<<<<<
> after check the status of our working directory, we can choose which file we want to track
>>> git add: the command to add the file to the staging area.

>>>>>>git commit<<<<<<
> now we can commit the change, this will commit all the files which is in staging area in our working directory.

>>>>>>git log<<<<<<
> check the commit history in the working directory

yangyu.xie GitStudyNote % git log
commit 98f4977c1c9da47a620e92d5ea89e61296e8985d (HEAD -> main)
Author: Yangyu-Xie <xlyxieyang@outlook.jp>

	initial commit

>>> commit 98f4977c1c9da47a620e92d5ea89e61296e8985d (HEAD -> main)

This is the commit "hash", this is used to uniquely identify the commit.

>>>>>>git checkout<<<<<<
> this is the command we use to roll back to the previous commit.


>>>>>>Remote Dipository<<<<<<
>PUSH: this is the command we use to push the local repository to github.
In the git hus repository, the url is provided.
>>> Step 1: tell our local repository that we have created a online repository. 
>>>>>>git remote add origin url.url.com<<<<<<
>>> Step 2: Push the commits
>>>>>>git push -u origin master<<<<<<


>>>>>>Branches<<<<<<
What is master branch
>>> this is the default or the main branch of all the commits.

Git allow us to create side branch.
What we can do here is, we can keep working our master branch and committing in the main branch, in the same time, we can add and test new features in our side branch.
We can also "Merge" master and side branches. so if we decide to add our new code to the master branch, we can just use a command to do so.


>>>>>>Important notes<<<<<<
When we modified the file, we need to make the file into staging area agin and commit it.
