Command for Git

>>>>>>git init<<<<<<

> first we would want to create a local git repository to store the files
>>>git init
this is the command we are going to use.


Execution Example: 
yangyu.xi GitStudyNote % git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/yangyu.xie/Desktop/GitStudyNote/.git/

This shows that I created a local repository in the directory: GitStudyNote
make sure we use ls and cd command to change to the current directory, so that our repository will build in the correct place.

this .git directory is hidden, we need to use ls -a to check it's existence.

>>>>>>git status<<<<<<
> Now we have the local repository, we can track the change in particular files
>>> Staging areea: in order to track changes in a particular files, we need to put the target file into a staging araa.
>>> Staging area is a intermidiate space, we can choose which file in our working directory we want to "Commit"
>>> git status: the command to check what is in the staging area.

>>>>>>git add<<<<<<
> after check the status of our working directory, we can choose which file we want to track
>>> git add: the command to add the file to the staging area.
